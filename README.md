# 01 Framework: This framework is to be used to quickly produce a bio for a person. Here is a link to the Github folder https://github.com/Emjayosee/Assignment02 and a link to the deployed file with more or less live data https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment02/.

# 02 Approach:

    1. You need to replace the images in the HTML code and the headshot, these are identified in the HTML file. 

    2. Repace the text and emaila and names where noted in the HTML page iles.
